# GitHub for me (github4m)

## Side note

The question is always "Why GitHub?". I am yet to see a project built with primarily black and white and looks awesome. It is robust too.

## Overview

This is a clone of [Github](https://github.com). I have earlier done this before but here is a combine effort of all my previous try which some were over 2 years ago. For your reference, kindly check out:

- [Githook](https://github.com/MubarakSULAYMAN/gitook) - Primarily has user search functionality with some query filter functions.

- [Githubb](https://github.com/MubarakSULAYMAN/githubb) - Optimize the full potentials of GitHub GraphQL API
- [Github](https://github.com/MubarakSULAYMAN/github) - A clone of Github home page

# What it does

A clone of GitHub search that features user and repository search. Use the search input to search for a keyword and select a user from the result to view their repositories.

## Performance & Optimization

In no way have I tested the performance. I only optimize if needed.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
